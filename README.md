## Install (Developer Mode)
1. `pnpm install` or `npm install` or `yarn`
2. `pnpm build` (or `npm run build`)
3. In Chrome: `chrome://extensions` â†’ Enable *Developer mode* â†’ **Load unpacked** â†’ select the `dist/` folder.

## Usage
1. Open any Workday job application (e.g., `*.myworkdayjobs.com`). Go to **Sign In / Create Account** or **Apply**.
2. Click the extension icon â†’ Load your JSON via file or paste into the textbox â†’ **Save JSON**.
3. Check **Auto-continue through steps** if you want automatic navigation.
4. Click **Start Autofill** while on the application tab.
5. The extension fills each step and tries to hit **Continue / Save and Continue / Next** up to several times.

> Tip: If a site uses unusual custom fields, the label-heuristic may not find a match. You can still proceed and manually fill remaining bits.

## JSON Shape
See `example.json` belowâ€”this is the structure the extension expects. Missing fields will be replaced with reasonable random values.

## Record the Demo
- Open a screen recorder (e.g., OBS or Chrome's built-in recorder).
- Start on the **Sign In / Create Account** page of a Workday posting.
- Click the extension â†’ **Start Autofill**.
- Record the extension filling **My Information â†’ My Experience â†’ Application Questions â†’ Voluntary Disclosures â†’ Review**.
- Stop recording at the **Review** page.

## Notes & Limits
- Workday UIs vary by company and configuration. This extension uses robust heuristics but cannot guarantee 100% coverage for every custom field.
- Please respect terms of service of the target site(s). Use for personal application convenience only.

## Dev
- Popup is at `src/popup/*`.
- Content script at `src/content/content.ts`.
- Shared helpers in `src/shared/*`.
- Build produces: `dist/popup/index.html`, `dist/content.js`, `dist/background.js`, and copies `manifest.json` + `icons`.
